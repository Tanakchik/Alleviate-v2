        <h1 class="head">Welcome to Alleviate</h1>
        <h2 class="head">Prison Leavers Re-entry Program </h2>
      <p id="para1">Alleviate Prison Leavers Re-entry Program is a non-governmental organisation which was established to fill the gap in-between post-conviction,
         prison release and reintegration into society. The organisation acts as a go-between for our clients and the community whilst bridging gaps, 
         breaking barriers, and breaching stigmatization and division created as a result of incarceration.
        </p>

       <h3 class="head">July 2022</h3>
       <p id="para2">The organisation is calling on all business owners and any other citizens to join us in taking a stance on fighting crime and poverty from an unusual standpoint.
         While a criminal record serves its administrative purposes in the criminal justice system, its effect on the bearer must be emphasized. We are quick to celebrate when
          a criminal is convicted, but we immediately forget that they will come out. Has anyone one of us wondered what happened to those who have been released from prison?
           How are they making a living, especially with a criminal conviction in toto? The fact is they are surviving but the question remains how? Alleviate Prison Leavers 
           Re-entry Program seeks to address this loophole. The organisation seeks to monitor the aftermath of conviction. 
         The very first struggles of a prisoner begin soon after release just outside the prison gates, with no transport! Without assistance, 
         they steal again. Some never make it home, they return. This may not be by design but the world we live in requires money to function. 
         Imagine a person stopping your car and then asking for a free ride into town. Would you accept? Most of us would find that outrageous and we will drive off speedily! 
         Fear would engulf us if we are to further realise that they have just been released from prison.
         We live them with no hope. We do not give them a chance. We isolate and reject them.
         In return, they retreat as ghosts of our community. Ghosts! Present but undetectable. Operating the system which you purportedly have control over. 
         We may not want to hear about this, but it is the stigma that we attach to the convicted citizens that backfires on us as a society. 
         It has been proven that when effective re-entry measures are taken, rehabilitation becomes a success.  We reduce recidivism, our communities became safer and we retain and control a would be lost human capital.
    
         <br><br>
         We therefore alleviate the prison leavers to become descend citizens making quite an honest living.
